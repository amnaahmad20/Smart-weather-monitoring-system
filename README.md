# My Weather Monitoring System Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Weather Monitoring System project, which utilizes ThingSpeak for data visualization and Tinkercad for circuit simulation.

## Tinkercad Circuit

This project's circuit was designed using Tinkercad. You can view and interact with the circuit simulation by following this link:

## Project Description

"Our Weather Monitoring System is an advanced, multi-sensor setup designed to provide real-time environmental data. 
Equipped with a temperature sensor, gas sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and a potentiometer, it accurately measures ambient conditions including temperature, 
air quality, rainfall, and wind speed. The collected data is visualized on the ThingSpeak dashboard, offering an intuitive and detailed view of weather patterns. 
This system is an essential tool for environmental monitoring, catering to both enthusiasts and professional meteorologists."
